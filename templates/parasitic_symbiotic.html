                    <h4 style="font-weight: 400; line-height: 2;">After completing site analysis for two different sites on campus, we came up with a small scale design. This design would remain the same and be parasitic to one site and symbiotic to the other. My concept ‘Journey: Into the Light’ was formed from one of my favorite sea caves in San Diego. I wanted to create a space that has a small and enclosed entry space which would then open up to an open seating and gathering area with water features to mimic the sound of the ocean.<br><br>For the final portion of the project we took our small scale design and then expanded it to fit the greater context of our site while still reflecting our concept. I decided to create a symbiotic landscape rather than a parasitic one. My final site location was the plaza between Baker Science and the Science Building. Throughout the design there are many coastal plants as well as a viewing deck of a sloping grass hill to reflect the vast open ocean.</h4>
