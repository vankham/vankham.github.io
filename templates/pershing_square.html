                    <h4 style="font-weight: 400; line-height: 2;">Pershing Square has gone through many redesigns throughout its time. With many different options going from victorian to modern, as it is now. The purpose of my redesign was to create a space where many could be able to utilize many different spaces of the plaza and also be able to provide a new refreshing look for the upcoming people that will soon be there to join in the neighborhood.<br><br></h4>
