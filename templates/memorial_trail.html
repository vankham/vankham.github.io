                    <h4 style="font-weight: 400; line-height: 2;">The AIDS Memorial Walk and Garden located near the Dairy Creek Golf Course in San Luis Obispo has shown many different areas for success or further improvement. The goal and overall mission of the project is to redesign the memorial to emphasize and create a place and sense of remembrance and reflection. The design will create a new and improved garden with the opportunity for users to fully take in the surrounding view-sheds and see all of the native plant species that also are plants with meanings of remembrance. <br><br></h4>
